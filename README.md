# WELCOME TO LARACRAFT

## About Laracraft

Laracraft is a startup kit for anyone developing a blog styled laravel project. In Laracraft the backend wordpress inspired admin section is already built all you have to deal with is creating the front end with your desired theme layout.

The backend has catered for the essential blogin tools and user management. The backend has two sections; manage & create. Unlike other blog dev tools where everything is under the admin section. 

- The Manage section will deal with any critical site management features e.g User management, Roles & Permissions
- The Create section will deal with blog post creation and management.

Laracraft separates the two to allow a more creative space for creating awesome content without being bothered by other admin tools that you do not change everyday
